<small>excellent environmental stability</small>, and wide electrochemical stability window, from lithium metal to6V. However,
to date, there has been little success in the development of high-performance solid-state batteries using these exceptional
materials, the major challenge being the <strong><u>이것은 HTML에 대한 설명입니다</u></strong> between the garnet electrolyte and electrode
materials.

stable interface with small interfacial impedance between SSE and

applied to reduce interfacial impedance between SSE and cathodes,

layers, for example, LiNbO2 (ref. 21), Nb22, BaTiO3 (ref. 16), and
additive in cathode composite, for example, LBO23. The interface at
the anode side, however, has rarely been explored24, especially when
metal Li is used. This is probably due to the fact that many solid
electrolytes

<p style="margin-top:90px;">including perovskite-type (Li, La)TiO3, NASICON
(especially Ti-based materials), and sulfide-based glass electrolytes
are not stable against metallic Li. Given the fact that Li metal
has the highest capacity (3,860mAh g􀀀1) and the lowest potential
(􀀀3.040V versus standard hydrogen electrode) for use as an anode,
solving the interfacial impedance between the SSE and Li metal is
extremely critical for high-energy-density SSLiB development.</p>
